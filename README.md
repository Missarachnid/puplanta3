##  A React, Redux and Firebase app for rating local dog parks and stores
This site shows all the dog parks and dog related stores in the greater Atlanta area. 
Clients can do the following:
*  View a list of all parks and maps in the area, address and a link to thier website
*  View all the locations on a Google Map, with a info pop-up on click
*  They can create an account to vote on parks and stores. The authentication is handled by Firebase
*  If they are signed in, clicking on one of the paw vote icons opens a page where they can vote "up" or "down"

###  Technology Used:
*  JavaScript/ES6
*  HTML/CSS
*  Bootstrap 4/ReactStrap
*  React
*  Redux
*  Auth and DB in Firebase
*  Hosted on AWS

###  Improvements I will make 
*  Cache assets for offline usablity(PWA)
*  Set up testing
*  User Docker
*  Possible image lazy loading
